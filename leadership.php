			<h2>Asif Ansari</h2>
			<h3>CEO and Founder</h3>
			<p>Asif Ansari has been a technical entrepreneur for over 20 years and is a life-long proponent of solar energy.  While in college he designed and built a small concentrated solar-powered Freon-113-based micro-turbine generator to drive a reverse osmosis water desalination unit for use in remote areas.  His focus then was to address the two main problems that still face the world today: clean energy and access to clean drinking water.  Mr. Ansari has since founded over a dozen successful companies in renewable energy, aerospace, alternative transportation, engineering and manufacturing, and global retail.  He has led the development and commercialization of over 20 technical products in the clean tech and aerospace markets.</p>
			<p>Mr. Ansari was formerly the CEO of eSolar, Inc., considered a world leader in solar thermal energy technologies.  His strategic vision towards project development for solar thermal power plants was radically different, targeting small, previously agricultural sites, using distribution lines for interconnection, and keeping the minimum economic size under 50 MW.  He formed the project development teams including experts in transmission, environmental, permitting, utility, and power plant construction.  Suntrough Energy is leveraging these experiences in pursuit of its projects. Mr. Ansari came to eSolar after serving as the EVP of R&D, Engineering and Manufacturing at Energy Innovations, where he led the engineering development of a heliostat-based concentrated PV product.  Prior to that, Mr. Ansari was the Founder and CEO of Omni Systems, a California based aerospace company where he led the design of NASA's Lunar Prospector Spacecraft, a lunar resource mapping mission that was successfully launched in 1998.  Mr. Ansari holds a BEME from NED University of Engineering & Technology in Karachi, Pakistan and an MSME from the University of Minnesota.</p>

			<h2>Fazal Chaudhry</h2>
			<h3>Chief Development Officer</h3>
			<p>Fazal Chaudhry has a passion for solar energy and now serves Suntrough as the company's Chief Development Officer (CDO). Prior to Suntrough, Mr. Chaudhry spent 30 years in land acquisitions and development and held various siting and permitting positions, including Director of Permits and Environmental Planning, Director of Land Acquisition, and Director of Land Development that formed the foundation of numerous solar parks. He has extensive experience in power plant siting, transmission and line routing, and regulatory affairs in the Middle East, Canada, and the US. Mr. Chaudhry has managed leading roles in refinery development, power plants, and major construction projects across Middle East and North America. He led the largest cluster of renewable energy projects in the world in the Antelope Valley Region of California by mobilizing city governments, politicians and the industry. As a Director of Land Acquisition & Development at eSolar, Inc. he sited, permitted, and acquired land for the future of eSolar's utility scale power generation for twelve sites in the County of Los Angeles, California. Prior to that, he was the CEO of CMF Land development where he lead the site acquisition, development and permitting of thousands of acres of desert land for solar projects.</p>

			<h2>Mark Fournier</h2>
			<h3>EVP of Project Management</h3>
			<p>Mark Fournier has over 30 years of global power plant experience and, as a project manager, was responsible for all phases of power plant design, development and construction. Prior to joining Suntrough Energy, he served as the Senior Vice President of Project Development at eSolar Inc., where he built the US's first commercially operating Solar Power Tower Plant in record time, the 5MW Sierra Generating Station in Lancaster, CA.  He also led the development of a 1 GW project pipeline of solar thermal plants across the Southwest US.  Before coming to the solar industry, Mr. Fournier was a Vice President and Senior Project Manager for Black and Veatch, a leading global engineering & construction company, and served on more than 50 power plant projects and prospects over a thirty year tenure, representing more than 10 GW of total generation. He has considerable depth of experience in all project phases including permitting, proposal preparation, contract negotiation, design, procurement, construction, commissioning, project control and closeout.  He has rich international experience having served in lead roles on power projects across North America, the Middle East, and the Far East, including Saudi Arabia, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.
