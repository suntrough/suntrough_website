			<h2>Small Scale</h2>
			<p>Suntrough Energy is uniquely positioned to make solar thermal plants economically viable at 10 MW in the developing world.  Our approach creates fully-packaged power plant solutions that drastically reduce the substantial on-site construction costs of traditional solar thermal projects. Suntrough Energy utilizes containerized power plant modules that address significant barriers to projects being brought online on-time and on-budget. Suntrough containerizes nearly every component of the power plant including the steam turbine and steam cycle, commoditizing solar thermal projects for the first time.</p>

			<h2>Bankable Technology</h2>
			<p>Suntrough is rapidly deploying and commissioning systems using "off-the-shelf" bankable parabolic trough technology that is well-understood by the industry. These generation assets will provide early revenue with predictable twenty-year income streams, as well as allowing us to continuously enhance the system and installation process for later projects.</p>
			<p>Future generations in Suntrough's product line will leverage our experience with initial system installations to fine-tune our technology.  We will work with established partners to customize existing designs in order to implement different heat transfer mediums and proprietary thermal storage systems to provide baseload generation.</p>
