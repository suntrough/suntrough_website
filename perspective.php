			<h2>The Challenge</h2>
			<p>Over 3 billion people in developing countries have inadequate access to clean water, reliable power infrastructure, and sanitation. More than 6000 people, the majority of them children, die each day due to inadequate drinking water. Moreover, 1.6 billion people do not have adequate access to electricity. By 2030, the world's population is projected to reach 8 billion with 97% of that growth occurring in developing countries. Building conventional power generation sources to bridge the growing gap between power and clean water supply and demand requires miles of costly transmission and distribution networks, and poses serious threats to the stability of the environment.</p>

			<h2>Global Approach</h2>
			<p>A fresh approach is needed to engineer solutions with adaptable architectures to overcome the barriers preventing clean energy and water development globally.  Suntrough Energy is uniquely positioned to revolutionize solar thermal projects across the world. By harnessing the inexhaustible clean energy from the sun, Suntrough Energy's new class of "clustered" 10 MW solar thermal plants are ideally suited for small to mid-sized generation at the village or community level in developing countries. For many of these communities, the only sources of power are environmentally damaging diesel generators.  Each 10 MW unit replaces the equivalent of 2,000,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually.</p>
			<p>These plants are built near the loads, avoiding the construction of costly and long lead time transmission lines. By offering a solution to lower the minimum economic size of a solar thermal system to 10 MW, Suntrough Energy is the first company to take on the global diesel power-generation market with the inherently reliable, pollution-free, and job-creating energy provided by solar plants.</p>

			<h2>Versatile Solution</h2>
			<p>Suntrough Energy's technology can be used in wide-ranging applications concurrent with solar energy generation. These include desalination and water-distillation plants, process steam plants, and absorption chillers for industrial air-conditioning or refrigeration. Suntrough is pioneering a new future where the energy and water problems of the world will be solved by the solar energy plants of today. We are all global citizens and it is our responsibility to commit to this global effort.</p>
